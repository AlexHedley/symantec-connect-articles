Hi All,
  
I've created a mini Utility App with a couple of functions to aid in your day to day work.
  
- HTML Encode/Decode
    - Sometimes when you log a Table in workflow it swaps the &lt; to &lt;, this converts it back and displays it in a webbrowser view
- URL Encode
- HEX to RGB
- SQL Builder (IN Clause)
- Guid
    - Zero Guid
    - New Guid Generator
- XML Pretty Print
- JSON Pretty Print
- SQL Formatter

This is still in development so please let me know if anything needs updating or if you can think of anything else I can add to make it more useful.
  
There is a chm Help file that comes with it, likely to be blocked, just with a little explanation and links to code used within the app.

**Mac**
  
Mac app has been added - still need to add a couple of tabs for the SQL functions. (9th Aug)
