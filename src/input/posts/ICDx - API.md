## API

> ICDx provides both AMQP-based and REST APIs. The headers and message content are identical for both APIs.  
> 	ICDx uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) as its primary protocol and interface. AMQP is a networking protocol that enables conforming client applications to communicate with conforming messaging middleware brokers.  
> 	The ICDx API is defined as a set of JSON-encoded messages and headers, which are sent and received over a message bus. ICDx uses the RabbitMQ implementation of AMQP.
